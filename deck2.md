#### A brief history of Lean

</div>

Notes:

 -Model T produced by Ford from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable and mass-produced car
-The Toyota AA was the first car Toyota produced in 1936

--

With the Ford T

- Started with the perceived 'perfect' product
- Strived to add value to the customer by standardizing the production and removing cost from the manufacturing process
- Large batches and economies of scale

--

With the Toyota AA

- Seek perfection and maximize value to the customer
- Remove waste from the manufacturing process (e.g. overproduction, waiting, unnecessary transport, over-processing, excess inventory, unnecessary motion, defects)
- Produce in small batches for a more efficient pipeline (flow)

--

#### Waste

<img src="https://kanbanize.com/wp-content/uploads/website-images/kanban-resources/muda-mura-muri.png" width="70%">

Waste = anything that does not add value to the customer, but we can generalize to anything that does not add value to the project (does not contribute towards the SMART objectives)

Notes:

- The core premise behind Lean is to eliminate waste
- Muri (overburden) - machines and people can not work beyond their capacity
- Muda (wastefulness) - activities that do not add value
- Mura (unevenness) - e.g. having to crunch just before a deadline to meet the deadline

#### Eliminating waste

According to Toyota

1. Transport in excess of what is required
2. Inventory in excess of what is required
3. Motion between processes
4. Waiting got processes to finish or people/machines that are unavailable
5. Over processing beyond what is required
6. Overproduction ahead of demand
7. Defects and parsing poor quality down the supply chain
8. Skills not seeking expertise and creativity

#### Just-in-case (push) vs just-in-time (pull)

--

Just-in-case (push): make all we can just in case

- Production approximation
- Large batches
- High inventory
- Management by fire fighting

--

Just-in-time (pull): make only what is needed when it is needed

- Production to demand
- Small batches
- Low inventory
- Management by sight

#### Jidoka (intelligent automation)

Ability to self-monitor and self-correct

#### 7 principles of Lean manufacturing

1. Eliminate waste
2. Amplify learning
3. To defer commitment
4. Deliver fast
5. Empower the team
6. Build integrity in
7. See the whole

Notes:

- So how are the Lean principles relevant to us?
- Do you see anything here that would be exclusive to manufacturing?

#### Lean manufacturing in action: Kanban

Notes:

- As orders come in, burgers removed from regulator
- Replenished on-demand (JIT) by the kitchen
- Not made to a forecast and pushed to a customer (who may not want a burger) as that would be wasteful

#### Minimum viable product (MVP)

![Cartoon strip showing benefit of a skateboard vs. a set of car wheels.](assets/imgs/Screenshot%20from%202023-06-20%2009-34-40.png)

Notes:

- The idea is that it is more valuable to provide a full useful thing rather than parts of a more complex thing
- e.g. you want to provide mobility but don't have the capacity to build a car, so you build a skateboard
