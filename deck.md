# Project Management

Initiating and executing projects

---

## Agenda üóìÔ∏è

--

Session 1: Initiating projects

- Project-business equivalency
- Project charters (aka. one-pagers)
- The power-interest grid
- Identifying & writing SMART objectives
- The Iron Triangle - capturing scope, time and cost

<!-- TODO: Julius what do you think would be valuable to share with them? -->

--

Interim: Drawing up a project charter

--

Session 2: Executing projects

- What to produce? - LEAN (MVPs)
- How to produce? - Agile
  - Waterfall and its problems
  - Agile as a solution (the manifesto)
  - Scrum (framework for promoting Agility)

<!-- TODO: Maybe add a section AI for your business? -->

--

Extra: Resources and tools

- Trello (Kanban)
- Figma (digital/print prototyping)
- Version control your management docs (these are evolving documents)

### Project-business equivalency

For small businesses and startups

`$$ project \equiv business $$`

Notes:

- Took me while to get to grips with when I was being taught all the PM practices at university
- A lot of project management is managing a breadth of projects in a large organization with a lot of stakeholders, this is not your case!
- You can get away with a lot less
- Being small has its advantages (principally agility)!

--

### Project charters

> A project charter formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides PM with the authority to apply resources.

Notes:

- This comes from large organization where you need to unlock resources to start your project, hence you must justify to the business and stakeholders that it is worth doing
- You don't have a need to justify yourselves to a large organization or business, but it is still a useful exercise to do
- The project charter allows you to have one document that you can refer back to when you are making decisions about the project
- It allows you to quickly have an overview of the project and remind yourself of the project's objectives
- It can be shared with potential funders, partners to give them a quick and clear understanding of what it is you are doing
- It should be a living document (evolving as the project evolves)

--

Encompasses:

- Statement of Work (SoW) / Project mandate
  - What is the project?
  - What are the assumptions?
  - Some high level definition of scope and constraints (budget and time frame)
- Business case (justify the effort and resources)
  - Does this project deliver real value to the business?
  - What similar projects have been done before?

Notes:

- We'll go through this template together...

### Managing stakeholders

> Stakeholder management is the process of maintaining good relationships with the people who have the most impact on your work.

--

These could be

- Sponsors (internal or external)
- Customers, end-users
- Sellers
- Partners
- Suppliers
- Governments, regulators...

The power-interest grid

<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Porto-Geciane/publication/280560177/figure/fig2/AS:614120046989320@1523429037826/Power-Interest-matrix.png" width="50%">

General rule of thumb:

- KS - Involve, engage, consultant (as they pose a risk)
- MC - Involve in decision, communicate regularly
- KI - Make use of interest
- ME - Inform, low priority

Notes:

- The power-interest grid is a tool to help you identify your stakeholders and how to manage them
- I don't think it is massively useful, but as quick exercise, grab a piece of paper draw out a grid and try to place your stakeholders in the grid
- Formalized way of ensuring who are the key stakeholders

--

Exercise:

1. Curate a list of all the stakeholders that affect your project together with your team
2. Take a piece of paper and plot those stakeholders on a power-interest grid

<!-- TODO: Make a doc for listing out the stakeholder and placing them in quandrants -->

--

### Objectives

- The project charter lists the project's deliverables/scope (i.e. what we are going to make/do?)
- It also lists the project's objectives/goals (desired outcomes or benefit) (i.e. why are we doing this?)
- Each stakeholder may have different objectives!

--

Outputs, outcomes, benefits and objectives

- Output/deliverable - what we're going to produce (the '**what**')
- Outcome - the change that the output will bring about (the '**so what**')
- Benefit - the value that the outcome will bring (the '**why**')
- Objective, which is the projects goals, is the desired/intentional outcomes and/or benefits

--

SMART framework

- Helps to formulate objectives that capture outcomes and benefits in a measurable way
- **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-bound (i.e. SMART)

E.g.
> To [improve/increase/enhance] [something] by [some amount] by [some date].

--

Some objective antipatterns:

> - Optimize the system/process
> - Maximize the potential of...
> - We will maintain the service in an ongoing way
> - We will implement x by y

Notes:

- Optimize and maximize are platitudes, so the objectives are unattainable and unspecific
- No mention of when the project will be completed (not time bound)
- We will implement x by y - no clear benefit

--

Worked example

- Output (*what?*): A drone that can monitor crop health in an automated way
- Outcome (*so what?*): Farmers get feedback on crop health regularly without driving to the field
- Benefit (*why is this good?*)
  - Don't damage the crop by passing over it with a tractor
  - Farmer can choose fertilizer and irrigation based off timely crop health data

Notes:

- Drone + software that allows it to be autonomous - output
- Note that the outcome doesn't specify the benefit (it can get a bit confusing)

--

Worked example (continued)

Capture the outcomes and benefits in our SMART Objectives:

1. To increase wheat and barley crop yields by 10% ((as a result of better fertilizer and irrigation management)) after the first year of deployment on farms in Germany
2. To decrease trampled crop damage due to tractors to nil as a result of using the drone over the first growing season where the drone is deployed
3. To decrease fertilizer and irrigation costs by 30% as a result of the drone data-driven recommendations over the first growing season where the drone is deployed
4. To decrease time spent monitoring crop health from 5h to 1h per week as a result of using the drone over the growing season

Notes:

- These objectives are achievable, we can measure to see if we have achieved them
- They are relevant to the project, and they are time bound

--

Exercise:

1. Would you be able to list the output (what?), outcome (so what) and benefits (so why) of your project?
2. Would you be able to capture the outcomes and benefits (hence objectives of the project) in a SMART way?

Notes:

- If you are unwilling to discuss openly on the call or chat, I suggest you create a new shared Google Doc with you team
- Ideally, I'd like to hear if anyone could share there output, outcome, benefits with me on the fly and formulate a SMART objective

### The Iron Triangle

<!-- change size of image -->
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Project-triangle-en.svg/1200px-Project-triangle-en.svg.png" width="50%">

- The triangle is rigid
- Quality is constrained by cost, time and scope
- The trick is figuring out where the stakeholders priorities lie

--

With many projects, unfortunately, this is the case

Notes:

- You start very ambitiously, and midway through you run out of steam and have to cut corners
- While the iron triangle is sort sudo-science (it's not a law), it does make you reason about the trade-offs you're making when you're working on your project
- It's OK to cut corners, just make sure you're not cutting your head off

--

Notes:

- You can only have two
- For example you can focus on reducing cost and time, but you'll have to cut scope

--

Prompting questions ü§î:

- Can you think of what might be the most limiting factor for startups?
- Are there any potential trade-off decisions you may need to make in your projects?
- Can you tell me what is most valuable to your project (scope, time or cost)?

Notes:

- If you are working in medical technology, scope takes precedence over time and cost
- However as a startup, time is often the limiting factor

---

## Interim

Write up your project charter.

This will involve you thinking about the most

- important constraints (scope, time, cost)
- identify stakeholders
- identify benefits
- objectives
- risks
- scope

Here is a spreadsheet template

## Project execution

- So you have your project charters, your objectives, your stakeholders, your risks, your scope

What about planning?

And when do you get to start doing
