## Initiating projects

--

For small businesses and startups

`$$ project \equiv business $$`

Notes:

- Took me while to get to grips with when I was being taught all the PM practices at university
- A lot of project management is managing a breadth of projects in a large organisation with a lot of stakeholders, this is not your case!
- You can get away with a lot less, but you still need to be able to manage your projects
- Being small has its advantages, and you'll see over the course of the session

### The Iron Triangle

- The triangle is rigid
- Quality is constrained by cost, time and scope
- The trick is figuring out where the stakeholders priorities lie

--

With many projects, unfortunately, this is the case

Notes:

- You start very ambitiously, and midway through you run out of steam and have to cut corners
- While the iron triangle is sort sudo-science (it's not a law), it does make you reason about the trade-offs you're making when you're working on your project
- It's ok to cut corners, just make sure you're not cutting your head off

Notes:

- You can only have two
- For example you can focus on reducing cost and time, but you'll have to cut scope

--

Prompting questions ðŸ¤”:

- Can you think of what might be the most limiting factor for startups?
- Can you see any potential trade-off decisions you may need to make in your projects?
- Can you tell me what is most valuable to your project (scope, time or cost)?

Notes:

- If you are working in medical technology, scope takes precedence over time and cost
- However as a startup, time is often the limiting factor

### Project charter (aka. one-pager)

> The Project Charter formally authorizes the existence of the project and provides PM with the authority to apply resources.

Encompasses:

- Statement of Work / Project Mandate
  - What is the project?
  - What are the assumptions?
  - Some high level definition of scope and constraints (budget and time frame)
- Business case
  - Does this project deliver real value to the business?
  - What similar projects have been done before?
  - Justify the effort and resources!

### Managing stakeholders

> Stakeholder management is the process of maintaining good relationships with the people who have the most impact on your work.

These could be

- Sponsors (internal or external)
- Customers, end users
- Sellers
- Partners
- Suppliers
- Governmence, regulators...
