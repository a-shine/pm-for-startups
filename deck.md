# Project Management

Initiating and executing projects

---

## Agenda üóìÔ∏è

--

Session 1: Initiating projects

- Project-business equivalency
- Project charters (aka. one-pagers)
- The power-interest grid
- Identifying & writing SMART objectives
- The Iron Triangle - capturing scope, time and cost

<!-- TODO: Julius what do you think would be valuable to share with them? -->

--

Interim: Drawing up a project charter

--

Session 2: Executing projects

- What to produce? - LEAN (MVPs)
- How to produce? - Agile
  - Waterfall and its problems
  - Agile as a solution (the manifesto)
  - Scrum (framework for promoting Agility)

<!-- TODO: Maybe add a section AI for your business? -->

--

Extra: Resources and tools

- Trello (Kanban)
- Figma (digital/print prototyping)
- Version control your management docs (these are evolving documents)

## Initiating projects

### Project-business equivalency

For small businesses and startups

`$$ project \equiv business $$`

Notes:

- Took me while to get to grips with when I was being taught all the PM practices at university
- A lot of project management is managing a breadth of projects in a large organization with a lot of stakeholders, this is not your case!
- You can get away with a lot less
- Being small has its advantages (principally agility)!

--

### Project charters

> A Project charter formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides PM with the authority to apply resources.

Notes:

- This comes from large organization where you need to unlock resources to start your project, hence you must justify to the business and stakeholders that it is worth doing
- You don't have a need to justify yourselves to a large organization or business, but it is still a useful exercise to do
- The project charter allows you to have one document that you can refer back to when you are making decisions about the project
- It allows you to quickly have an overview of the project and remind yourself of the project's objectives
- It can be shared with potential funders, partners to give them a quick and clear understanding of what it is you are doing
- It should be a living document (evolving as the project evolves)

--

Encompasses:

- Statement of Work (SoW) / Project mandate
  - What is the project?
  - What are the assumptions?
  - Some high level definition of scope and constraints (budget and time frame)
- Business case (justify the effort and resources)
  - Does this project deliver real value to the business?
  - What similar projects have been done before?

### Managing stakeholders

> Stakeholder management is the process of maintaining good relationships with the people who have the most impact on your work.

--

These could be

- Sponsors (internal or external)
- Customers, end-users
- Sellers
- Partners
- Suppliers
- Governments, regulators...

The power-interest grid

<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Porto-Geciane/publication/280560177/figure/fig2/AS:614120046989320@1523429037826/Power-Interest-matrix.png" width="50%">

General rule of thumb:

- KS - Involve, engage, consultant (as they pose a risk)
- MC - Involve in decision, communicate regularly
- KI - Make use of interest
- ME - Inform, low priority

Notes:

- The power-interest grid is a tool to help you identify your stakeholders and how to manage them
- I don't think it is massively useful, but as quick exercise, grab a piece of paper draw out a grid and try to place your stakeholders in the grid
- Formalized way of ensuring who are the key stakeholders

--

### Objectives (and being SMART)

- The project charter lists the project's deliverables
  - The project scope i.e. What we are going to make / do
- It also lists the project's objectives
  - The project goals (desired outcomes or benefit)
  - i.e. Why are we doing this
- Each stakeholder will have different objectives!

--

Outputs vs. outcomes vs. objectives

- Output / deliverable - what we're going to produce (the 'what')
- Outcome - the change that the output will bring about (the 'so what')
- Benefit - the value that the outcome will bring (the 'why')
- Objective = the projects goals (desired outcomes or benefit)

Framework for capturing objectives: SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

--

Worked example

- Output: A drone that can monitor crop health in an automated way - can you think of the output of your particular project? (the 'what')
- Outcome:
  - Farmers get feedback on crop health regularly without driving to the field
  - Don't dammage the crop by passing over it with a tractor
  - Can choose fertiliser and irrigation based off timely crop health data
- Objectives (measurable benefits):
  - Increase crop yield by 10%
  - Decrease crop damage by 5%
  - Decrease fertiliser and irrigation costs by 5%
  - Decrease time spent monitoring crop health from 5h to 1h per week

Now you try!

Framework for SMART objectives:
 capturing the benefit, ouctcome or improments

> To [improve/increase/enhance] [something] by [some amount] by [some date].

Specefic, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART)

Instead of throiwing platitude such as optimse, maximise the potential of the progarm or we will be carrying out in an ongoing way 
or we will implement x by y - no clear benefit

### The Iron Triangle

<!-- change size of image -->
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Project-triangle-en.svg/1200px-Project-triangle-en.svg.png" width="50%">

- The triangle is rigid
- Quality is constrained by cost, time and scope
- The trick is figuring out where the stakeholders priorities lie

--

With many projects, unfortunately, this is the case

Notes:

- You start very ambitiously, and midway through you run out of steam and have to cut corners
- While the iron triangle is sort sudo-science (it's not a law), it does make you reason about the trade-offs you're making when you're working on your project
- It's OK to cut corners, just make sure you're not cutting your head off

Notes:

- You can only have two
- For example you can focus on reducing cost and time, but you'll have to cut scope

--

Prompting questions ü§î:

- Can you think of what might be the most limiting factor for startups?
- Can you see any potential trade-off decisions you may need to make in your projects?
- Can you tell me what is most valuable to your project (scope, time or cost)?

Notes:

- If you are working in medical technology, scope takes precedence over time and cost
- However as a startup, time is often the limiting factor

---

## Interim

Write up your project charter.

This will involve you thinking about the most
- importnnt constraints (scope, time, cost)
- identify stakeholders
- identify benefirs
- objectives
- risks 
- scope

Here is a spreadsheet template

## Project execution

- So you have your project charters, your objectives, your stakeholders, your risks, your scope

What about planning?

And when do you get to start doing
